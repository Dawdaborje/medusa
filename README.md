# 🐍 Medusa

**Medusa** is a simple, lightweight in-memory key-value store inspired by [Redis](https://redis.io), built entirely in **Rust**.

This project is **not meant for production**, but rather as a personal learning experiment to better understand:

- How low-level data storage works
- TCP networking and client handling
- Command parsing and response formatting
- Systems programming using Rust

## 📚 Why "Medusa"?

Just like Redis is known for its speed and power, Medusa channels those traits on a much smaller and friendlier scale. The name is symbolic — it may not turn you to stone, but it might turn your brain toward systems design. 🧠⚙️

## 🎯 Goals

Medusa is built for:
- Exploring how databases like Redis work internally
- Learning Rust in a hands-on way
- Building something fun and functional, from scratch

## 🚫 Not a Real Redis Clone

This is **not** a full Redis implementation.
You won't find clustering, persistence, or advanced data types (yet).

This is about **understanding**, not replicating.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **Rust** – Safe and fast systems programming language
- 🧪 Curiosity and patience

## 💡 Inspiration

- [Redis source code](https://github.com/redis/redis)
- [Build Your Own Redis in C](https://build-your-own.org/redis/)
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run Medusa (after it's functional):

```bash
cargo run
